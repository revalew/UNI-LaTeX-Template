# $\LaTeX$ Template   [![Build LaTeX document](https://github.com/revalew/UNI-LaTeX-Template/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/revalew/UNI-LaTeX-Template/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is the backup repository of the $\LaTeX$ template, which I created for my academic documents. By any means it is perfect, but I will work on it to improve the functionality. The template will be heavily tailored to my style and liking.

What I want to achieve:

- Create a good looking template for my academic papers,
- Learn how to improve in typesetting,
- Learn about $\LaTeX$,
- Learn how to use Git & GitHub.
